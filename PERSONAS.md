# Personas

In order to abstract away from specific use cases and
implementation details, we will use terms from the story
of *Glen and Larryâ€™s Ice Cream Company*.

Each of these personas describes those involved in the
ice cream supply chain, and has a relevant parallel
relating to OCI and the surrounding software ecosystem.
